# Custom Drawer Navigator

This is a solution for a Frontend Mobile Developer role challenge that consist in replicate a drawer animation in React Native.

## The challenge

- Build a drawer menu similar to the design received
- Add a couple of random screens based on a pattern

### Requeriments

- The screen should be built using React Native
- Use of Typescript is required
- Tab navigation needs to be configured
- Pay attention that the Drawer needs to be a parent component of other children

### Result

## My process

### Built with

- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript
- React Navigation

### Continued development

TypeScript could be implemented more in deep that the current version. Maybe polish some styles in other components as tab buttons.
